# Text Classification of Political Bias assisted by Explainability Techniques

Undergradute thesis advised by professor Thiago Faleiros at the Computer Science department at the University of Brasilia, the paper proposes to estimate the political bias of texts automatically using artificial intelligence. Written in portuguese.

The performance of multiple supervised machine learning models are compared, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost and transformer-based models like BERT. Furthermore, the project uses LIME to provide interpretable explanations for which factors influenced the classification of bias.

Details of the text preprocessing strategies, model implementation, explainability and analysis can be found in the code in this repo and in the [report](https://github.com/gcvasconcelos/unb-classification_political_bias/blob/main/monografia.pdf).
